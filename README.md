# GWAS-Correlation-Platform
A platform for determining significant risk factors for specific diseases using computational algorithms.
 - Languages: HTML/ CSS, Javascript, Python, Flask, R

I am currently creating a service using a GWAS database for running large-scale statistical analysis and ML upon to determine significant causal factors for specific diseases. For now, I am focusing on leukemia and lymphoma, but I plan to branch out in the future.
